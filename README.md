This program is built to take advantage of the database functionality of MYSQL and incorporate the server side Javascript functionality of Node.js.
The Bamazon G Store first displays the table from MYSQL to the user and then asks which item the user would like to buy. The user is able to choose an item and provide a quantity and the Bamazon Store then calculates how much money the user owes and updates the table in MYSQL with the correct remainaing quantity. These values are then displayed for the user.
If the the user wants to buy more than is available they get a "There are not enough in stock for that transaction" message.
If the item_id entered by the user is incorrect, the program will notify the user.
